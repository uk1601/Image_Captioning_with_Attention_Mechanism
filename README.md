# Image Captioning with Attention Mechanism

## Project Overview

This project implements an advanced image captioning system leveraging deep learning architectures, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), enhanced by an attention mechanism. The system is designed to generate descriptive and contextually relevant captions for images, using a rich dataset for training and evaluation. The project is structured into two Jupyter notebooks: one focusing on training and preliminary evaluations, and another dedicated to inference and deployment scenarios.

## Features

- **CNN Encoder**: Uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model to extract features from images.
- **RNN Decoder with Attention**: Employs multiple GRUs with an attention mechanism to focus on different parts of an image for caption generation.
- **Model Checkpointing**: Supports saving and loading the model's state to resume training or perform inference.
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes images in batches during training.
- **Flexible Inference nethodology**: Evaluates images from directories or URLs and visualizes attention weights to understand the focus of the model.

## Detailed Explanation of Steps and Methodology

### Training Phase

**Environment Setup**
- Initial setup involves importing essential Python libraries such as TensorFlow for machine learning, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib for plotting. This step sets the stage for subsequent data manipulation and model construction.

**Data Loading and Preprocessing**
- Utilizes the COCO 2017 dataset, known for its rich annotations for object detection and captioning. Images are resized and normalized to conform to the input requirements of the CNN. Captions are tokenized using TensorFlow’s `tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer`, converting text data into sequences of integers.

**Model Architecture**
- **CNN Encoder**: Adopts the ResNet50 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet for robust feature extraction from images. This component converts input images into a condensed feature representation.
- **RNN Decoder with Bahdanau Attention**: Implements a sequence-to-sequence model with attention. The RNN layer generates captions by predicting one word at a time, with the attention mechanism focusing on different parts of the image for each word prediction, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of the generated captions.

**Model Training**
- Employs the Adam optimizer for efficient stochastic gradient descent and a custom sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function to handle the variability in caption length. Training involves iterating over batches of data, leveraging TensorFlow’s efficient data pipeline management through `tf.data.Dataset`.

**Evaluation**
- Basic evaluation measures the trained model’s performance on a validation set, assessing the qualitative accuracy of generated captions against ground truths. This helps in fine-tuning parameters and model architecture.

### Inference Phase

**Environment and Model Setup**
- Loads the trained model weights and tokenizer, setting up the TensorFlow environment for inference. This step is crucial for applying the trained model to generate captions for new images.

**Single Image Captioning**
- Provides functionality to input a single image, process it through the trained model, and output a caption. This function demonstrates the model's capability to generalize from training to novel images.

**Batch Image Captioning from Directory**
- Extends the model's application to multiple images, processing entire directories. This is particularly useful for large-scale deployment scenarios where batches of images need automated captioning.

**Captioning for Images from URLs**
- Facilitates the downloading of images from specified URLs and generating captions, simulating a real-world application where images might not be locally available.

## Conclusion

The Image Captioning with Attention project effectively demonstrates how state-of-the-art machine learning techniques can be harnessed to create descriptive captions for images. The project highlights the integration of CNNs for fixed-length image encoding and RNNs for variable-length text decoding, enhanced by an attention mechanism that dynamically focuses on parts of the image relevant to each word in the caption. This system not only advances the field of automated image understanding but also provides a robust framework for further experimentation and development.
